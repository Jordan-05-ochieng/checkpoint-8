ere are the algorithms for both of your problems, following the instructions for using arrays and nested loops.

Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements
This algorithm finds the sum of all elements that are unique to either of the two given sets. It uses a straightforward comparison method as you described.

Algorithm: SumDistinctElements
Initialize sum and arrays:

SET_1 = [3, 1, 7, 9]
SET_2 = [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
sum = 0
Iterate through the first set:

For each element e1 in SET_1:

Create a boolean flag, is_present = false.

Use a nested loop to iterate through each element e2 in SET_2.

If e1 is equal to e2, set is_present = true and break the inner loop (no need to check further).

After the inner loop finishes, if is_present is still false, it means e1 is distinct. Add e1 to sum.

Iterate through the second set:

For each element e2 in SET_2:

Create a boolean flag, is_present = false.

Use a nested loop to iterate through each element e1 in SET_1.

If e2 is equal to e1, set is_present = true and break the inner loop.

After the inner loop finishes, if is_present is still false, it means e2 is distinct. Add e2 to sum.

Final Result:

The variable sum now holds the total of all distinct elements.

Problem 2: Dot Product and Orthogonality
This problem is broken down into two main parts: a procedure for calculating the dot product, and an algorithm that uses it to check for orthogonality.

Part A: Dot Product Procedure (dot_product)
This procedure takes two vectors (arrays) and a variable to store the result, which is passed by reference. This means the procedure modifies the original variable directly.

Procedure dot_product(v1, v2, ps)
Initialize result variable:

Set ps = 0.

Iterate and calculate:

Loop from i = 0 to the length of the vector arrays.

In each iteration, calculate the product of the corresponding elements: product = v1[i] * v2[i].

Add this product to ps: ps = ps + product.

End Procedure:

When the loop finishes, the variable ps will contain the final dot product.

Part B: Orthogonality Algorithm
This algorithm uses the dot_product procedure to check if n pairs of vectors are orthogonal.

Algorithm: CheckOrthogonality
Initialize:

Get the number of vector pairs, n, from the user.

Create two arrays, v1 and v2, to hold the vectors.

Main loop:

Loop n times, from i = 1 to n.

Inside the loop:

Prompt the user to input the elements for vector v1 and v2.

Create a variable scalar_product.

Call the dot_product procedure: dot_product(v1, v2, scalar_product).

Check for orthogonality:

If scalar_product is equal to 0, print "The vectors are orthogonal."

Otherwise, print "The vectors are not orthogonal."

End Algorithm.

Part C: Modified Algorithm with a dot_product Function
This version is similar to the previous one, but the dot_product is now a function that returns the result, which is a more common approach in many programming languages.

Function dot_product_function(v1, v2)
Initialize a local variable:

result = 0.

Iterate and calculate:

Loop from i = 0 to the length of the vector arrays.

result = result + (v1[i] * v2[i]).

Return the result:

Return the value of result.

Modified Algorithm: CheckOrthogonality_Function
Initialize:

Get the number of vector pairs, n, from the user.

Create two arrays, v1 and v2, to hold the vectors.

Main loop:

Loop n times, from i = 1 to n.

Inside the loop:

Prompt the user to input the elements for vector v1 and v2.

Call the dot_product_function and store the return value:

scalar_product = dot_product_function(v1, v2).

Check for orthogonality:

If scalar_product is equal to 0, print "The vectors are orthogonal."

Otherwise, print "The vectors are not orthogonal."

End Algorithm.
